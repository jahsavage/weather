This project can be loaded into Android Studio and built or from the gradle command line.

The task has been performed using a mixture of Java and Kotlin mainly since I used several components from an existing project I had previously written

All the plumbing for getting the data to the UI is legit

The UI bit was time consuming so several shortcuts have beeen made for fun.

Further work is required to understand how to map the weather to an icon or understand the ones from the API
